# CS350

These Projects were the most difficult for me, and therfore where I learned the most.
But, what I learned was not just limited to these projects.
Leaning how to interact with files on a seperate computer, in a terminal without any UI, has shown me how I take for granted many conveniences.
It was aggravating, but again interesting, moving files between the two, trying to understand errors, etc.
I still need to improve in this area, to become more adapt at keyboard shortcuts and navigation.
What I feel like I did well, however, was understanding the python code and the given codebases.
While I was not familiar with breadboards and the GPIO and raspberry pi software, I felt I picked up on it easily.
The navigability of smaller scale systems will help mein other courses understanding base level processes.
I tried to keep in line with encapsulated code, so I hope I can use some functions I made in the future.
